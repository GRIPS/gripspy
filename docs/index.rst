Welcome to `gripspy`!
=====================

Introduction
------------

This Python package is intended for analysis of data from the `GRIPS <http://grips.ssl.berkeley.edu>`_
long-duration flight of 2016 January 19â€“30.
It can also be used to analyze the pre-flight calibration data that was already being recorded
using flight-like packet formats.
The code is still very much a work in progress, so not only are many elements still missing,
even the parts that have been coded are likely to go through changes in their interfaces and
organization.
